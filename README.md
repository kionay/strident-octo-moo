Experiment with predictive text.
Currently this alternative ranking branch is slower than the master branch by about 65%
It is more accurate, but only by maybe 1%.
I like how this is organized better, but I don't like the performance hit
If someone stumbles upon this and finds a faster way to implement the ranking to be faster than an average of 12ms per item then by all means I would love to see it improved.

Maybe I will try harder at tackling the performance, but for now I'm going to let this branch gather dust.
